## Week 1: Developer Tools
#### [Design for the Web 2](https://github.com/ccny-edm/web2)

Before we begin, please fill out the [student survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lMjTXflX3SHJvwfyvbkKLXRVmN0XgcdPijFT18zVDFg/edit).

The first developer tool we are going to learn about is [GitHub](https://github.com/), a popular code sharing and hosting service. It has quickly become the dominant tool for collaborating with developers, and for distributing open source code. GitHub is also used for [all sorts of stuff](http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government) that has nothing to do with code.

### Build a mobile-friendly web page

The assignment this week is to build a mobile-friendly website. We are going to use GitHub to host it (for free), and start becoming familiar with the conventions of code repositories. Your page can be extremely simple, just some HTML and CSS. It should include at least one image that you have previously created and uploaded to the internet (if you have never uploaded an image to the internet, use [Flickr](https://flickr.com/) or [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) to upload a new one.)

Create a very basic page, that looks good on a mobile web browser. You don't need to care about desktop or tablet screens, just mobile.

### Reading

We have a reading that accompanies this week's assignment: [All you need is publish](https://medium.com/message/this-is-how-we-publish-b050172dcb05)

#### Sign up for GitHub

1. Start by creating a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/).
2. Leave the plan set to "free" and click the green *Finish sign up* button.
3. Check your email, you should have a message with the subject "[GitHub] Please verify your email." Click on the link to verify your email address. (You should make sure to open the link in the same web browser you used to sign up.)
4. On the resulting page, click the *Confirm* button next to your email address.

#### Create a new code repository

1. Now that you're signed in on GitHub, notice on the top-right part of the page it shows a plus sign button next to your username. Click on that and choose *New repository*.
2. In the box that says *Repository name*, enter your username followed by `.github.io`. So if your username is "alice" you would enter `alice.github.io`. Typing this *exactly right* is important, so double-check it before you continue.
3. Click the green *Create repository* button.
4. On the next page, you'll see a lot of information. You can ignore most of it, just look for the part that says "We recommend every repository include a..." and click on the README link.
5. Type in a short description, something like "I am building my personal portfolio site here." (Type your description under the `=======================` part, which is a formatting rule from [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).)
6. Click on the green *Commit new file* button on the bottom of the page.

Congratulations, you have created your first GitHub repository.

#### Hello, World

1. At this point you should have a page open at a URL like `https://github.com/alice/alice.github.io` (of course, with your username in place of `alice`). Click on the plus button as shown in this screen shot to create a new file:  
  ![Create a new file](img/new_file.jpg)
2. Type `index.html` into the box that says "Name your file."
3. Type in some basic HTML (see this [template](template.html) for a starting point).
4. Click the green *Commit new file* to upload your page.
5. Visit *[your username]*.github.io to see your new page! (If this doesn't work at first, give it a few minutes and see if it appears.)

You now have a new website, exciting!

#### Mobile first

1. We're going to use GitHub's web-based editor to update the index.html page you just created. Click on the filename `index.html`. You should see the HTML you typed before.
2. Click on the pencil icon just above your code to edit the file's contents.
3. Make some adjustments, try to improve on what you wrote earlier.
4. Click *Commit changes* when you're ready to test things out.
5. You can continue to add additional files, such as a stylesheet, by clicking on the same plus button you used in the *Hello, World* section above.
4. Continue editing and saving your HTML and CSS until you have something you're happy with.

Remember, you should be checking your work on a phone, since we only care about mobile browsers for this week's assignment.

#### Ask for help early

If you get confused along the way, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm available via email (dan at phiffer dot org), or to meet up by appointment. You'll be certain to get better results by asking for help earlier than later.
