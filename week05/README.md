## Week 4: CSS Transitions and Animations
#### [Design for the Web 2](https://github.com/ccny-edm/web2)

This week we will adapt an existing animation, embellishing it using the transition/animation CSS techniques we covered in class.

### Find an animated GIF

Browse the web for an animated GIF you would like to adapt. Try searching on [Giphy](http://giphy.com/) or browse through the archives of [Mlkshk](http://mlkshk.com/) to find one you like.

### Build a web page

Build a new web page around your chosen GIF. Use CSS to position and size it on the page in a way that you find effective. Download the GIF and refer to your own copy of it in your `<img>` tag, but also link to the original source somewhere on the page.

### Add animation

Finally, add your own embellishments to the GIF using additional HTML and CSS animations and/or transitions. You might want to animate the position, size, or opacity of the GIF, or of elements you place around it. It's up to you! Try to enhance the underlying qualities of the GIF using your CSS additions.
